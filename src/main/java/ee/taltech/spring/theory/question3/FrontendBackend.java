    // How do Frontend and Backend communicate between one another in a modern application? Elaborate a bit.
    //They communicate using http requests. HTTP requests are created inside users browser and they contain data and
    //with the help of that data they request certain information.

    // Let's define an Rest API for Orders. Order.java exists as an example. You don't need to write code in this examples, just educated comments :)
    // Rest API usually has to fulfill following 5 goals (define HTTP method and url):
    // 1 retrieve a list of orders
    // 2 retrieve one order by its identifier
    // 3 save new order
    // 4 update existing order by its identifier
    // 5 remove order by its identifier
