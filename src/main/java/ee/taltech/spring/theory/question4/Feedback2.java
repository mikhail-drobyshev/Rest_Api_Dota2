    //todo
    // this assignment is only for team member 2
    // The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go
    // Pretty good. First part of the course was clear and understandable but when it came up to spring it still
    // not completely clear for me

    //todo p1
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // 7
    //

    //todo p2
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // Level of materials. Jokes (please keep doing this)
    //
    //

    //todo p3
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // Not 100% comprehensive. Lack of theory (text based, on some other courses we have 50 slides every lecture
    // with detailed explanation of every detail.)
    //

    //todo p4
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    // More slides.
    //
