    // What is Dependency Injection? Describe it a bit.
    //It means, that one object takes care of the dependencies of another object. It is basically like a middle man,
    //that takes care for all needed dependencies for a class.
    //todo p2
    // What is Inversion of Control (IoC)? Describe it a bit.
    //It is similar to dependency injection, but in this takes IoC means, that you let someone else handle your
    //objects, meaning you let some other class create, destroy your objects and etc.
    //todo p3
    // Bring one example of Dependency Injection in "project 2".
    // P.S No need to create a new example, just use code from "project 2".
    //CalculatorService would be an example of Dependency Injection in our project.
